types of Module:::

1.) feature --> inward, outward

2.) shared --> this module will have import->{componentName} also export ->{componentName} as this module will be used by others as well
	e.g ImageModule (can b used by inward,outward both)

3.) core or Service module --> just focuses on service so just provider->{AuthService,anyOtherservice}
	rest of the modules can import serviceModule to make other modules cleaner


So a Broader picture will be as below
