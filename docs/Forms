Types of forms:
1.) Reactive
2.) Template driven

standard building block used by both reactive & template
* Form group:
* Form control:
* Form array:
* ControlValueAccessor : It creates a bridge between Angular FormControl instances and native DOM elements.

Template drive:: (e.g sibling1)
import FormsModule from @angular/forms
Validations:: required,email required,maxlength,minlength,
ng-touched : controls have been visited
ng-untouched : controls have not been visited
ng-dirty : control-value has been changed
ng-pristine : control-value has not been changed
ng-valid: Controls value are valid
ng-invalid: Controls value are Invalid


Reactive Forms:: (e.g sibling2)
import ReactiveFormsModule from @angular/forms

setValue() ==> will have to set all formcontrols else error :used while getting values from other service
patchValue() => can set partial vaues in the form     :used while getting values from other service
